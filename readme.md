Every java application is organized into multiple logical layers. The **Data Access layer** is for performing database operations. **Services layer** is where the business logic goes. **Presentation layer** presents the application to the client. **Integration layer** is responsible for communication with other applications. Each layer uses services provided by the other layers.
